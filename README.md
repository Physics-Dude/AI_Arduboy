# AI_Arduboy
A dorky game for Arduboy handhelds.

This is an Arduboy game titled: AI ARDUBOY

The idea is that you have to teach an AI what 'modules' are constructive or destructive. There are over half-a-million possible modules. You have to hurry though, if it loads a module before you train it, you loose points. If you guess improperly, the AI will start to show signs of corruption! ooooOO!

Inspired in part by  ZackFreedman's Singularitron/SingularitronFirmware/flavortext.h Thousands of aditional vocabulary words were added from inspirition gained from various
websites I visit, and Discord servers I frequent. Thanks to those that chimed in!  
Includes small fonts by filmote.
