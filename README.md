The idea is that you have to teach an AI what 'modules' are constructive or destructive. There are over half-a-million possible modules. You have to hurry though, if it loads a module before you train it, you loose points. If you guess improperly, the AI will start to show signs of corruption! ooooOO!

Inspired in part by ZackFreedman's Singularitron/SingularitronFirmware/flavortext.h well over a thousand additional vocabulary words were added from inspiration gained from various websites I visit and Discord servers I frequent. Thanks to those that chimed in! Additional phrases and programming insight by OpenAI's ChatGPT.
